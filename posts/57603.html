Oppenheimer’s Ending Felt So Devastating [DownSub.com]</h1>

<p>I think it does seem to leave people with some appropriately…

<blockquote>
<p>我们的确试着在结尾适当地留给观众一个…困难甚至是痛苦的问题。<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce" aria-label="I think it does seem to leave people with some appropriately...

</blockquote>
<p>When taken at face value, the ending to Oppenheimer gives us a final
glimpse into the tormented mind of the father of the nuclear bomb,
revealing a dreadful vision of humanity having opened a Pandora’s Box
that can never be closed again, that has set in motion, as he says to
Einstein, a chain reaction that will destroy the entire world.</p>
<p>从表面意义上看，《奥本海默》的结尾让我们最后得以一窥这位原子弹之父受到的精神折磨。他看到了可怕的未来——就像他在剧中对爱因斯坦说的——人类已经打开了一个潘多拉魔盒，开始了一个无法终止，并最终将毁灭整个世界的链式反应。</p>
<p>“It’s an old, defining fear that has been dormant in recent years,
but it’s never really gone away, has it?” – Bilge Ebiri wonders in his
review of the movie. “Recent events in Russia and Ukraine have served as
grisly reminders that we all remain just a hair trigger away from
incinerating ourselves in a nuclear holocaust.”</p>
<p>“这是一种长久的，明确的忧虑。这种忧虑也许近年来变淡了，但它从来没有完全消失，不是吗？”Bilge
Ebiri
在他的影评中写道：“俄乌冲突重新给我们敲了警钟：我们离核战争只有一步之遥。轻轻按下那一个按钮，全世界每个人都将在核爆的烈焰中蒸发。”</p>
<p>However, as Ebiri also points out, Nolan doesn’t like being didactic,
he doesn’t like resolving his stories with one clear, simple message.
Instead, he wanted Oppenheimer’s ending to leave us with, as Nolan
himself put it, “a strong set of troubling reverberations [that] would
land differently with each individual watching the film.” And given how
I, like many others, haven’t stopped thinking about the movie since it
came out, I think it’s fair to say that he succeeded, that there are
some deeper meanings here that resonate far beyond the movie’s immediate
subject matter. And today, I want to find out what they are.</p>
<p>不过，就像Ebiri指出的，诺兰并不拘泥于教条。他不想给观众传达单一、清晰的信息。相反，诺兰本人表示，他希望《奥本海默》的结尾能给观众“一种强烈的、令人不安的精神回响，并且能在不同观众的心中，激发不同的感受和思考。”</p>
<p>鉴于像我，还有很多看过电影的人，都陷入了长时间的对故事的思考中，我觉得诺兰做到了。电影中涵盖着大量广泛、深层的意义，远远超出了电影的直接主题。
而在这里，我想弄清楚它们是什么。</p>

<p>I think the first thing you have to understand to get at the heart of
Oppenheimer is that for the first time in years, Nolan has made a
genuine tragedy. Unlike Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and the
Dark Knight movies, there is no heroic triumph here, only a tragic
downfall. In this sense, we’re better off comparing Oppenheimer to
Nolan’s earlier works such as The Prestige, Insomnia, and most
importantly; Memento.</p>
<p>首先要明确的是，诺兰《奥本海默》是他多年来首部彻头彻尾的悲剧作品。和《信条》《敦刻尔克》《星际穿越》《盗梦空间》和《蝙蝠侠：黑暗骑士》英雄一般的胜利结局不同，在《奥本海默》这里，只有不断下行的悲剧。鉴于这一点，我们更应该将《奥本海默》与诺兰的早期作品相比：包括《致命魔术》《白夜追凶》以及更重要的——《记忆碎片》。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not a killer. I’m just someone who wanted to make things
right.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>我不是杀手。我只是想让事情回归正轨。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Memento is especially relevant here because it has a very similar
structure as Oppenheimer, and this reveals the second thing that is
important for understanding the movie’s ending, which is its place
within the larger structure of the story.</p>
<p>《记忆碎片》对于我们理解《奥本海默》尤为重要。它和奥本海默具有非常相似的叙事结构。而理解片尾在全片叙事结构中所处的位置，是理解《奥本海默》片尾第二层意义的关键。</p>
<p>In Memento, we were presented with two timelines, one that one starts
at the very end of the story and that plays out in reverse chronological
order. And one that unfolds regularly from the earliest point in the
story. These timelines then continuously intercut and inform each other
until they ultimately converge in the middle, which to us is the end of
the movie.</p>
<p>《记忆碎片》大致给观众呈现两条叙事线<sup id="fnref:timeline"><a href="#fn:timeline" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce" aria-label="直译为时间线。">[2]</span></a></sup>。一条从故事的结局开始，随着电影的进行不断倒叙展开；而另一条按照正常的时间顺序从故事的开始延伸。随着电影的进行，两条时间线不断的相互交织，互相补足，并且最终，在时间线的中点相汇</p>
<p>Oppenheimer essentially pulls the same trick. Although its narrative
structure is arguably even more complicated than Memento’s, if we strip
it down to its absolute essence, there are also 2 converging timelines
here; one that follows Oppenheimer’s life up until the Trinity test in
1945, and one that begins with Strauss’s senate confirmation hearing in
1959 and that sort of looks backwards to cover everything that happens
after Oppenheimer creates the bomb.</p>
<p>The point of convergence for both of these stories is a conversation
between Oppenheimer and Einstein that took place in 1947, which is
hinted at throughout the movie, but which we don’t fully get to see
until the very end.</p>
<p>And the reason this structural context matters is because, going back
to Memento, it’s in this climax, or chronologically speaking, in this
middle section of the story, that we find a key revelation that not only
ties the two storylines together, but that also gives us a pivotal
insight into our main character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I lie to myself to be happy? Yes, I will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is exactly what the ending to Oppenheimer offers us from a
narrative point of view, it gives us one last insight into Oppenheimer’s
mind that helps us to understand both the true outcome of the first
timeline, of everything that happened before the Trinity test, as well
as the motivation that has been the true driving force of everything
that came after.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we all know, what happened later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what exactly do we learn here? Well, again, there is the most
obvious layer in which Oppenheimer expresses his belief that he has set
in motion a chain reaction that will eventually destroy the entire
world, which does seem like the logical outcome of his reckoning with
the actual consequences of having made the atomic bomb, and which also
serves as a valid character motivation for his actions in the
chronologically second half of the story in which he seems to almost
willingly submit himself to his Promethean torture in a somewhat
ambiguous plea for some kind of redemption or reconciliation.</p>
<p>But I think we can dig a little deeper than this, because besides
giving us character motivation, I believe the real reason why this
ending is so impactful is because it also captures a fundamental turning
point for Oppenheimer’s entire worldview, and I think it’s this
revelation that truly contains the troubling reverberations that Nolan
spoke of; that deeper sense of dread that pierced right through the
audience, and that struck so many, including myself, on what felt like
an unsettlingly intimate level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We imagine a future, and our imaginings horrify us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But first; some important contextual understanding. As film critic
Darren Mooney wrote in his review of Oppenheimer; “Before the atomic
age, the universe was understood through Newtonian physics.” In this
paradigm, as he explains, there were clear causalities, certainties. It
suggested that our universe was logical and deterministic, and
therefore, that it was knowable, understandable. But then quantum
physics came around and basically replaced these certainties with the
concept of probability, with the idea that there are aspects of our
world that are not knowable, that cannot be quantified.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a time of radical reinvention of the way in which we describe
the universe around us, the way in which we understand the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Oppenheimer shows us, it’s a transition that scared off the old
guard, including Einstein, but it excited a new generation, including
Oppenheimer. Before his eyes were filled with that hollow anguish, they
were hungry; entranced by visions of a hidden world, and by the idea of
unknown driving forces beneath our reality and even our own
consciousness.</p>
<p>For the quantum revolution wasn’t limited to physics, it was a
reflection, as Mooney writes, “of a much larger shift in human
understanding, playing out in art, culture, music, politics, and
psychology.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t want to try to explain that to the audience, but the idea
is; we want to see how radical this thinking was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, this was the age where Freud and Jung were mapping out the
subconscious, the unknown, hidden world within our own psyche that
shapes our identity through forces we cannot directly perceive, which of
course is another subject that Nolan has always been deeply fascinated
by.</p>
<p>Needless to say, for a scientist like Oppenheimer, it was a time of
excitement, and of promise, the promise of pioneering into a new world,
and domesticating it under the dominion of human civilization.</p>
<p>And this is the dominant perspective in the first half of the story,
again; that is the chronological first half of the story; it’s the tale
of a young scientist on the rise, becoming one of the leading experts in
his field, and then getting to combine his two great passions; physics
and New Mexico, into the greatest project of his time; one that was
going to create a devastating weapon of mass destruction, yes, but also
one that, in Oppenheimer’s mind, would bring about a lasting peace
unlike any we had seen before, one that would in many ways unite the
world in a global scientific endeavor, and usher in a new era of human
progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our work here will ensure a peace mankind has never seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to point out Oppenheimer’s naivety on this matter, but at
the same time, it is also understandable given how everything leading up
to the Trinity test had made him increasingly confident, consciously as
well as unconsciously, that the quantum world was not just controllable,
but that it was his to control, that he was the great man, the father of
not just the bomb, but of the nuclear age in its entirety.</p>
<p>But then the test happens, and everything changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s such an incredible turn in the movie. up until that point he’s
in full control of everything. He’s in charge, he’s in demand, he’s
telling people what to do. And then as soon as they make the bomb they
take it away from him and he realizes there’s no need for me
anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now, it’s become a common trope for Nolan’s characters, that
inevitable reckoning between grandiosity and reality. The realization
that the forces they thought they understood, that they thought they
could control, are actually controlling them, leaving them imprisoned in
self-made contraptions. It’s Nolan’s oldest fear, author Tom Shone
remarks, “that of being locked in – specifically, of locking yourself
in, willingly submitting to structures designed to protect you that turn
out, instead, to entrap you.” Security turns into anarchy, ambition
becomes obsession, order breaks down into an all-devouring chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hasn’t good come of your obsessions? At first, but I have followed
them too long. I am their slave. And one day, they will choose to
destroy me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so too it goes for Oppenheimer. As he finds himself increasingly
excluded from his own work, increasingly struggling to make sense of the
suddenly unfamiliar world around him, as well as of the suddenly
unfamiliar world within. Where once everything was, like the structure
of the Manhattan project, neatly compartmentalized; work, family,
affairs.</p>
<p>Where once theory could be separated from application, noble
intentions from actual outcomes, now, all boundaries are breaking down,
engulfing everything in an unstoppable fire. Instead of mastering the
quantum world, Oppenheimer has unleashed it, unto the world, and unto
himself, and in that process, he has doomed both.</p>
<p>As Bilge Ebiri points out; the wonderous visions of secret worlds
hidden in the raindrops have been completely replaced by apocalyptic
nightmares of horror and devastation. Instead of envisioning the
astonishing connections between all matter and even all human relations,
Oppenheimer now only sees total annihilation. “In his mind at least, he
has destroyed the world: He has destroyed his world, his very conception
of reality.”</p>
<p>“Fission and Fusion,” film critic David Ehrlich adds, “Nolan has
never come up with a cleaner way of framing the chemical reaction that
galvanizes so many of his films.” Indeed, Nolan’s frequent employment of
non-linear storytelling doesn’t merely bend time or play around with its
causal direction, it often serves to break it entirely. His stories
fragment themselves like atoms splitting apart and spiraling out of
control until the disparate pieces start slamming into each other again
in destructive combustions and symphonic revelations that let us
experience all at once; past, present and future. It makes, as Ehrlich
puts it, “discovery inextricable from devastation, creation inextricable
from destruction, and the innocent joy of theory inextricable from the
unfathomable horror of practice.”</p>
<p>This, perhaps, is the true source of Oppenheimer’s ruin; he shattered
his reality, and in doing so, he cast himself adrift, unstuck in time,
without any hope of reclaiming the blissful certainties he once enjoyed.
For as he recounts his days of youthful exuberance, the year is actually
1954, and he already knows exactly where his ambition will lead him.
Though at the time, he didn’t see it, his fate had already been written
in the raindrops, Ehrlich continues, leaving Oppenheimer skipping along
the surface with a dispassionate remove that can’t help but recall the
similarly detached Dr. Manhattan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tell her I still want her, and that I always will. As I lie to her,
it is September 4th, 1970, I’m in a room full of people wearing
disguises.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a particular tragedy to this disconnection from the linear
flow of time, one that was also there in Memento. Because as Leonard
willfully sets himself on the self-destructive path that we’ve already
seen him go down, we realize that even though the ending offers a
revelation, it doesn’t give us a resolution. Instead, a loop is created
that sends us right back to the beginning, where Leonard will once again
embark on the exact same journey.</p>
<p>But whereas Leonard’s memory condition left him oblivious to the
cruel fate he trapped himself in, Oppenheimer knows full well that he is
stuck in an endless cycle. He can see clearly the chain reaction he set
into motion, the inescapable prison that he built around himself, and
that he is now reliving over and over.</p>
<p>Every time, he will rebuild his world, experience his youth, his
passion, his hope. And every time, he will burn it all down again, and
despair in the ashes.</p>
<p>Prometheus chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.</p>
<p>Moving deeper into the subtext, there is an unsettling relatability
here that goes beyond the terror of nuclear annihilation.</p>
<p>Remember, Nolan wanted to invoke troubling reverberations that would
land differently with each individual watching the film, meaning that
while Oppenheimer certainly isn’t a direct allegory for other issues, it
does have symbolical applicability that allowed its ending to pierce
right into some broader existential fears that have been haunting our
collective psyche.</p>
<p>Because again, the quantum revolution in physics was but one part of
a greater transition in our modern society that, as we have now come to
realize, have opened us up to new dangers and vulnerabilities. For
besides having meddled with the fabric of reality, we’ve also been
altering the chemistry of our entire atmosphere, affecting
macroprocesses that take place within spatial and temporal dimensions so
vast that we can hardly perceive them. We’ve been interconnecting
ourselves over the entire globe, physically as well as digitally,
embedding ourselves within increasingly complex and fragile systems. And
just as Oppenheimer, we too are now increasingly facing the consequences
of these achievements.</p>
<p>I think it is fair to say that everyone, in some way or another, is
aware of this, that everyone has felt the uncertainty of what all these
developments really mean, the dread of where they might be taking us,
and the frustration of trying to figure out our own relation to
them?</p>
<p>Because are we not, at the end of the day, allowing all this to
happen? Are we not part of the same all-devouring machine as the
scientists at Los Alamos were? Are we not also just playing along
pretending everything will be fine while deep down we’ve long since come
to realize that it won’t?</p>
<p>But then again, what can we do? Was Oppenheimer ever really in a
position to change things? Wouldn’t the bomb have been created with or
without him? What becomes of individual agency when we realize we have
fallen into a giant machine that is not ours to control, and that now
makes us question if it ever was, if we ever had any real agency to
begin with.</p>
<p>Because can the powers that shaped the course of our history truly be
traced back to deliberate intentions and human ingenuity, to great men
and great deeds, and the active engagement with human progress. Or has
the real power been hiding in the shadows? Secretly directing our fate
through an escalating chain reaction of silly coincidences, petty
motivations and dumb luck? A man goes on a honeymoon, and years later,
he saves an entire city from annihilation, while destroying two others.
Another man sparks a decade-long vendetta, all based on a simple
misinterpretation. Do we actively write our history, or does it just
happen to us? And if so, what becomes of us then? If we cannot
meaningfully alter the system we’re so intrinsically a part of, can we
carve our an island for ourselves? Can we find scapegoats to take away
our own inner turmoil, other individuals who we can blame so that we can
imagine ourselves unburdened, unconflicted? Or do we become martyrs
ourselves? Do we cast ourselves on the rock to allow our own torture?
After all, punishment is followed by redemption, right? A pat on the
back, and all is forgiven. Is this how we justify our lives? As
Oppenheimer so painfully emphasizes, by having stolen fire from the
Gods, by having meddled with forces far greater than ourselves, it feels
like we have broken our fundamental concept of reality, and in doing so,
we have found ourselves increasingly displaced, struggling for
understanding, for certainty, for some kind of reconciliation or
absolution.</p>
<p>And this, as Darren Mooney concludes, is the bleak and lingering
question hanging over Oppenheimer: how can humanity be expected to
understand the existential dangers threatening its survival, when it
cannot even understand itself.</p>
<p>Nolan is far from the only filmmaker to have dabbled with themes of
apocalyptic dread and existential despair. A while back, I made a video
titled the apocalyptic filmmaker that haunts my soul, which is about
Béla Tarr, one of my favorite directors of all time. His magnus opus,
the almost 7,5 hour long Satantango, stands among the greatest
achievements in cinematic history. As a movie, it’s a bleak yet
beautiful odyssey into a desolate world defined by Nietzschean
philosophy, false prophets, and the struggle for meaning. As an
experience, however, especially if you watch it, as I did, entirely in
one sitting, it is quite simply indescribable. It’s truly one of those
movie you just have to have seen at least once, and it is now available
